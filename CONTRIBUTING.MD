# Contributing to HBAsets

Thank you for your interest in contributing to HBAsets! :smiley::tada:

HBAsets is a project that aims to reuse open brain transcriptome data to facilitate polygenic analyses and create molecular brain maps.

This documents is a set of guidelines for contributing to HBAsets on GitHub. These are guidelines, not rules. This guide is meant to make it easy for you to get involved.

If your guide is long, consider adding a table of contents.

## Participation guidelines

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to derek.howard(at)camh.ca.

## What we're working on

Check out this [Roadmap](https://github.com/derekhoward/HBAsets/wiki) to get a better idea of the direction this project is taking.

 The project is comprised of 3 main parts:
- data processing to transform the wide variety of open transcriptome data into reference datasets
- analysis to determine the brain areas which co-express the genes of interest
- an application to allow a user to provide gene lists as input and to interact with the results of the analysis

We need many different skills to help build this tool, and you can help! Take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/derekhoward/HBAsets/issues) that have been raised and keep an eye out for issues with labels of interest.

## How to submit changes

Once you've identified one of the issues above that you feel you can contribute to, you're ready to make a change to the project repository!

1. First, describe what you're planning to do as a comment to the issue, (and this might mean making a new issue).
It's a good idea to check in with others to ensure you don't work on something that overlaps with work that is already under way.
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [HBAsets repository](https://github.com/derekhoward/HBAsets).
This makes your own version of this project you can edit and use.
3. [Make your changes](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-changes)!
You can do this in the GitHub interface on your own local machine. Once you're happy with your changes...
4. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/). This opens a discussion around your project and lets the project lead know you are proposing changes.
